  First I want to say that each human life is valuable.  
  We should never treat these numbers as mere statistics as each death is a tragic loss for someone.  
  Working from home I became concered about the psychological impact of the news. 
  The best way I could analyze the information is new cases per day for a specific area.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  Search for county or state and click the link to the county page.

<table id="index_table" class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped">
  <thead class="">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">State</th>
      <th scope="col">County</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for item in data %}
      <tr>
        <td>{{ item.state }}</td>
        <td><a href="{{ url_for( 'show', name=item.name ) }}">{{ item.county }}</a></td>

  Their dashboard is here https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html but I wanted different presentation.
