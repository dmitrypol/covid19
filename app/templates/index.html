First I want to say that each human life is precious.  
We should never treat these numbers as mere statistics as each death is a tragic loss for someone.  
<br>
Working from home for the last few weeks and reading news articles talking about ever increasing death toll I became concered about the psychological impact of this information. 
<br>
The most objective metric I could think of is the number of deaths per day for a specific area.  
Other numbers such as count of diagnosed cases will be impacted by the increased testing.  
The more people we test the more will be diagnosed with COVID-19. 
But we should not loose hope, there are positive developments in the fight against this disease.  
<br>
I am not a doctor or a scientist but a software engineer in Seattle.  
I was not able able to find an easy dasbhoard to view this data so I built one.
